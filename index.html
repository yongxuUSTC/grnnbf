<p>Purely NN based speech separation method, although can achieve good objective scores, inevitably cause nonlinear speech distortions that are harmful for ASR [5]. On the other hand, the mask based traditional MVDR beamformer, although can significantly reduce speech distortions, has limited noise reduction capability. Recently we proposed an all-deep-learning minimum variance distortionless response (ADL-MVDR) method where the unstable matrix inverse and principal component analysis (PCA) operations in the MVDR were replaced by recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, it is not clear whether the success of the ADL-MVDR is owed to the calculated covariance matrices or following the MVDR formula. In this work, we demonstrate the importance of the calculated covariance matrices and propose three types of generalized RNN beamformers (GRNN-BFs) where the beamforming solution is beyond the MVDR and optimal. The GRNN-BFs could predict the frame-wise beamforming weights by leveraging on the temporal modeling capability of RNNs. The proposed GRNN-BF method obtains better performance than the state-of-the-art ADL-MVDR and the traditional mask-based MVDR methods in terms of speech quality (PESQ), speech-to-noise ratio (SNR), and word error rate (WER).</p>
<p>Different from previous deep beamforming work [12], the proposed GRNN-beamformer method disassembles the deep learning &quot;black box&quot; with explicitly calculated target speech and noise covariance matrices in the intermediate layer. The calculated frame-wise target speech and noise covariance matrices have concrete physical meanings to derive the optimal frame-wise beamforming filter.</p>

<p>15-element non-uniform linear microphone array and colocated 180 degree wide-angle camera for our real-world video and audio recording</p>
<p>For the real-world videos, as the 180-degree wide-angle camera is colocated with the linear mic array, the rough DOA of the target speaker could be estimated according to the location of the target speaker in the whole camera view [1]. Face detection and face tracking are conducted to track the target speaker's DOA. (Note that in our simulation data, there is no need to do face tracking, because the video of each overlapped speaker is already in single-face mode after the data cleaning and filtering process.)</p>
