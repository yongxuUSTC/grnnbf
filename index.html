<p>15-element non-uniform linear microphone array and colocated 180 degree wide-angle camera for our real-world video and audio recording</p>
<p>For the real-world videos, as the 180-degree wide-angle camera is colocated with the linear mic array, the rough DOA of the target speaker could be estimated according to the location of the target speaker in the whole camera view [1]. Face detection and face tracking are conducted to track the target speaker's DOA and lip movement. (Note that in our simulation data, there is no need to do face tracking, because the video of each overlapped speaker is already in single-face mode after the data cleaning and filtering process.)</p>
